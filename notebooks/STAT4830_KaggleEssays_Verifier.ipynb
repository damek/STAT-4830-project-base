Even in number system you will find material for long reflection. Remember that Leibniz did not disdain to occupy himself with it.\\u2019 \\u2013 Paul Val\\u00e9ry, letter to Pierre Honnorat, 1942There are almost too many examples of the power and pervasiveness of mathematical ideas. For instance, this essay was written on a computer. The software of the computer, its mind and spirit, if you will, is a compilation of code that is based on the ideas of Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, and his article \\u2018A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\u2019 (1948). But perhaps this is both too obvious and too slight an example. The personal computer is hardly an essential part of human existence, even if most of us have structured our lives around it today. Let\\u2019s take something more basic and widespread, something most of us probably already apprehend, even if only dimly \\u2013 like the idea of regression to the mean. As the Oxford English Dictionary explains, regression to the mean is \\u2018the tendency for the values of any distributed variable to move towards the mean over repeated independent trials\\u2019. In other words, the more trials, the less random or mistaken the measure. For instance, say you\\u2019re in a race at school. You do surprisingly well and beat most of your classmates. All things being equal, the next time around, you\\u2019re actually not likely to do as well, relative to the other runners. Obviously, one\\u2019s actual rank depends on skill and talent \\u2013 if you did well the first time, you probably are pretty fast \\u2013 but each result also depends on luck as well as a host of other circumstances. Therefore, in order to mitigate against any selection effect, one has to run the experiment multiple times. In order to be able to see just where you actually place or rank, you have to be able to know the shape or form of the distribution of outcomes. The notion of regression to the mean informs how we think about a wide range of things, from the design of clinical trials, to gambling, to, well, the prosaic pep-talks we give ourselves after coming up short by saying: \\u2018OK, next time will be better.\\u2019 Actually, it probably will be. The Victorian polymath (and eugenicist) Sir Francis Galton first discovered and formulated the idea of regression to the mean in his studies of heredity. The \\u2018regression toward mediocrity\\u2019, in Galton\\u2019s memorable phrase, grew out of his studies of why genius seemed to run through families (think of the Bachs), but then also how and why it dissipated over time. Genius and talent themselves being impossible to measure, Galton studied other more quantifiable phenomena, for instance, the height differences between parents and children, and the spatial distribution of falling objects. He devised a contraption called the Quincunx, and found that when uniformly dropped objects encountered small deviations (think of a pinball machine with lots of stoppers), they nevertheless distributed themselves at the bottom along a normal distribution \\u2013 what we generally call a bell curve. The bell curve, of course, is just one example of the various forms used to plot the relationship among independent and dependent variables. Galton\\u2019s conceptual innovation, his idea of regression to the mean, made certain features of the world newly visible. By doing so, he helped us count and describe other things we can\\u2019t see, or test, but that shape our lives. The modern separation among scholars between intellectual history and the history of mathematics is untenable as mathematics might be the ultimate intellectual endeavour. In the words of the 19th-century German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss: \\u2018mathematics is the queen of the sciences\\u2019; like literacy, widespread numeracy is one of the defining features of modernity. In fact, one of the great shifts of modernity has been how mathematicians changed their view of mathematics, transforming the focus of their work from the study of the natural world to the study of ideas and concepts. Perhaps more than any other subject, mathematics is about the study of ideas. Yet, when people invoke the history of ideas, you are unlikely to hear about Dedekind\\u2019s cut (that is, the technique by which the real numbers are rigorously defined from the rational numbers), or L E J Brouwer\\u2019s rejection of Aristotle\\u2019s \\u2018law of excluded middle\\u2019, which states that any proposition is either true or that its negation is (put technically: for all propositions p, either p or not p). Nor are you likely to hear about the contested history of these ideas. Generally, when they talk about ideas, intellectual historians today mean political thought, cultural analysis, and maybe a sprinkling of economic and religious concepts, too. Nor has this divide been one-sided. As the historian John Tresch recently noted: \\u2018For most historians of science trained in the past 30 years, doing history of science has meant avoiding the history of ideas.\\u2019 Even though most historians of science would surely consider the history of mathematics part of their field, in fact the subject is more often conspicuous by its absence than its presence. However, the larger problem among historians of science is that, while the consolidation of the field over the previous century has been an institutional and economic success, it has segregated the field. Today, it primarily takes place within separate departments or committees, with separate training. This reinforces, in practice and effect, a division between the study of science and the study of society \\u2013 something its own literature repeatedly criticises. \\u2018Mathematics, like any literature, is created by human beings for their own amusement\\u2019 One of the many damaging results of this intellectual division is that most of us \\u2013 that is, those of us who are not mathematicians, physicists or engineers \\u2013 adopt a view of mathematics that is primarily the product of our encounter with it in grade school. For most people, unfortunately, mathematics is a set of confusing, repetitive, formalistic and abstract techniques. Yet this is exactly the opposite of how mathematicians see their own work. Rather, what attracts them, in the words of The Mathematics Lover\\u2019s Companion (2017) by the graph theorist Ed Scheinerman, are \\u2018joyful, beautiful\\u2019 theorems and proofs, which they arrive at through the sweat of intellectual play. Akin to the best poems, they contain truths about the world perfectly expressed. Perhaps the most impassioned remonstration against our bifurcated view of mathematics is the pamphlet A Mathematician\\u2019s Lament (2009) by the American private-school teacher Paul Lockhart. Written in 2002 and circulated for years among mathematicians and educators, Lockhart\\u2019s essay ruthlessly criticised the simplistic nature of most mandatory mathematics education. Mathematics, Lockhart wrote, is almost always taught in a way to obscure the actual insights and reasoning, the grandeur and insight, the excitement and frustration, that drive mathematicians. \\u2018At no time are students let in on the secret that mathematics, like any literature, is created by human beings for their own amusement,\\u2019 Lockhart writes, attempting to humanise the subject. Continuing with his literature analogy, Lockhart emphasises that: \\u2018A piece of mathematics is like a poem, and we can ask if it satisfies our aesthetic criteria: is this argument sound? Does it make sense? Is it simple and elegant? Does it get me closer to the heart of the matter?\\u2019 And like most pieces of art, truly appreciating it is not a rote exercise: \\u2018works of mathematics are subject to critical appraisal; that one can have and develop mathematical taste\\u2019. By teaching mathematics as a series of techniques, the appeal and nature of mathematics is masked: \\u2018Of course there\\u2019s no criticism going on in school \\u2013 there\\u2019s no art being done to criticise!\\u2019 The notable English mathematician G H Hardy also compared mathematics to poetry in his own work A Mathematician\\u2019s Apology (1940): \\u2018A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.\\u2019 What then might we all learn from better integrating the two? What might be gained if, to quote Egon Spengler in the film Ghostbusters (1984), \\u2018we cross the streams\\u2019 of the history of mathematics and the history of ideas? We should not understand the history of ideas as one besotted by speculations about politics. With that, hopefully, we can gain a wider sense of the diverse ideas and visions that, deep down (for better and for worse), motivate and inform any of our endeavours. Intellectual history today is dominated by elite political ideas. There are many factors that have contributed to the shortchanging of the history of mathematics and its ideas. High among them is how narrowly political the work of leading intellectual historians has been. The British scholar Quentin Skinner and the French philosopher Michel Foucault, for example, are arguably the most influential intellectual historians of the past 50 years. Superficially, they are unlike each other in almost every way, from their prose style, to their subjects. Yet both portray intellectual history mostly in terms of political languages and expressions of power. The discourses and mentalities of individuals, for both of them, describe much of the social and political world, and account for when and why change happens. But one of the most important reasons for the rise of the modern state is the increasing possible reach of politicians and bureaucrats, changes powerfully facilitated by improvements in mathematics and technology, and that are absent in both of their accounts. Recognising the role of mathematics in the history of how we think would actually make us more sophisticated in our political judgment. Those wishing to lend certainty and authority to their ideologies use mathematics, but they also abuse it. As the epitome of formal knowledge and the premier example of abstract reason, the spectre of mathematics has haunted European thought for centuries. From theologians to politicians and economists, many have naively \\u2013 even manipulatively \\u2013 adopted mathematical methods to develop, and too often implement, overly simplistic theories of the world. Despite the repeated problems with this approach, the impulse has been seminal, formative and comparatively neglected. The discipline of economics offers a recent example, but this is also true for areas as widely separate as architecture and philosophy, as the political scientist and anthropologist James C Scott shows in his book Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1999). The allure of formal schemes has turned people\\u2019s attention to the results of mathematics, rather than to the creative ways that mathematicians work and think. Commenting on the aftermath of the late 19th- and early 20th-century controversy over the foundations of his subject, the influential mathematician John von Neumann wrote in the essay The Mathematician (1947) that \\u2018[T]he very concept of \\u201cabsolute\\u201d mathematical rigour is not immutable. The variability of the concept of rigour shows that something else besides mathematical abstraction must enter into the makeup of mathematics.\\u2019 While the reason that mathematics is authoritative is due of its supposed rigour and certainty, what we mean by rigour has changed throughout history, based on novel ideas and realisations. How mathematics works rests on no absolute timeless standard, despite what many assume today, given its precision and efficacy. Taking mathematics seriously might lead thinking back to questions of aesthetics and beauty In some ways, mathematics is the hardest, and most realistic, art. The German philosopher Martin Heidegger, for instance, offers an example of an influential thinker who misrepresented mathematics as a kind of thinking divorced from the natural world. In the essay \\u2018Modern Science, Metaphysics, and Mathematics\\u2019 (1962), he writes: \\u2018In the mathematical project develops an obligation to principles demanded by the mathematical itself.\\u2019 In Heidegger\\u2019s view, the embrace of mathematics and technology brings a kind of repetitious, routinised, alienating world in its wake. The paradox, however, is that a desire to bypass repetitious exercises is precisely one of the things that motivates mathematicians. Elementary proofs are nothing if not ways to think about something in all applicable cases so that repetitive testing on each possibility is not necessary. Nothing could be more elegant. Describing technology and mathematical modes of thought as mechanistic and alienating mistakes the result for the process. Finally, taking mathematical ideas seriously might lead to discovering that technical ideas are as important as political or religious ones. Taking mathematics seriously might also, counter to stereotypes, lead thinking away from current preoccupations with culture and power, and back to questions of aesthetics and beauty. Aesthetics and beauty are ever-present concerns in art and in mathematics, though seemingly small matters to historians and humanists today, preoccupied as they are with power. Take, for example, the case of the Weils: Simone Weil was an important literary and political writer, regarded as one of the more insightful religious philosophers and social critics of the first half of the 20th century; her brother Andr\\u00e9, a mathematician, made important contributions to a variety of areas of mathematics, but is much less widely known, unless one is a mathematician. There are many colourful anecdotes about Andr\\u00e9 Weil\\u2019s life \\u2013 he escaped war-torn Europe and lived all around the world \\u2013 but perhaps most importantly, and amusingly, he was a founding member the Bourbaki group. This was a loose association of mostly French mathematicians in the first half of the 20th century who tried to put mathematics on a new and self-contained basis (a recurring goal in the history of mathematics and, more generally, the history of thought). One of the main ways they tried to achieve this goal was by collectively writing textbooks under the name of a fictitious character, one Nicolas Bourbaki. Bourbaki doesn\\u2019t exist, but he published not a few books, and came up with some of the terms and symbols modern mathematicians use, such as \\u00d8 to represent the empty set. Andr\\u00e9 Weil led the first meeting of the Bourbaki group. And Weil is just the beginning. There\\u2019s Shannon and his insights into information theory, along with his teacher, the prodigy Norbert Wiener, who coined the term \\u2018cybernetics\\u2019 (and wrote a scintillating two-volume autobiography). There\\u2019s the debates between Brouwer and David Hilbert about the basis of mathematics. And there\\u2019s the extraordinary career of Emmy Noether, who made contributions across many fields of mathematics and physics, and helped to apply abstract algebra to topology (which deals with the preservation of spatial properties during transformations of shape and size, and is one of the main ways topology is done today). In other words, it would mean beginning to be as interested in the creators of our technological civilisation as history has been in those who lament it. The history of ideas can, should and, historically, has often been precisely about the limitations of politics and the rewards of other ideas; it need not primarily be the study of thinkers who, more often than not, never even directly held power. The ideas that most deeply shape us, and our societies, are just as often not part of the history of political thought, but come from many other areas. This is not an argument for a neo-Platonic worshipful examination of ideas, or for a move away from considerations of politics. It is rather a call to recognise the ways in which humans actually encounter ideas, and the unique vitality of mathematical ideas in the world. \",\n          \"The rise of the internet and the widespread availability of digital technology has surrounded us with endless sources of distraction: texts, emails and Instagrams from friends, streaming music and videos, ever-changing stock quotes, news and more news. To get our work done, we could try to turn off the digital stream, but that\\u2019s difficult to do when we\\u2019re plagued by FOMO, the modern fear of missing out. Some people think that our willpower is so weak because our brains have been damaged by digital noise. But blaming technology for the rise in inattention is misplaced. History shows that the disquiet is fuelled not by the next new thing but by the threat this thing \\u2013 whatever it might be \\u2013 poses to the moral authority of the day. The first time inattention emerged as a social threat was in 18th-century Europe, during the Enlightenment, just as logic and science were pushing against religion and myth. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1710 entry from Tatler as its first reference to this word, coupling inattention with indolence; both are represented as moral vices of serious public concern. Philosophers and moralists at the forefront of cultural construction characterised the \\u2018habit of inattention\\u2019 as not simply a stand-alone moral failing but the source of other vices. In An Essay on Truth (1770), the Scottish moral philosopher James Beattie, who gained a reputation for voicing the moral anxieties of his epoch, located inattention as the source of the \\u2018criminal habits\\u2019 that \\u2018debase the moral faculty\\u2019. He asserted that \\u2018we have contracted many evil habits, which, with proper attention, we might have avoided\\u2019. Beattie associated inattention with \\u2018unkindness and dissatisfaction\\u2019 and warned that if this vice was allowed to flourish, social order would be undermined. In England, 18th-century literary commentators such as Richard Steele, a founder of The Guardian, and the essayist and moralist Samuel Johnson regarded inattention as a symptom of an \\u2018undetermined manner of thinking\\u2019. They offered advice on ways to counter \\u2018that hurry of mind\\u2019 to \\u2018which some busy spirits are subjected\\u2019. One of the most widely cited 18th-century sources of advice on the problem of inattention was The Elements of a Polite Education: Carefully Selected from the Letters of the Late Honourable Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield, to his Son (1774). \\u2018I know no one thing more offensive to a company, than inattention and distraction,\\u2019 Chesterfield wrote in March 1746. In a letter written in January 1752, he equated inattention with a \\u2018laziness of mind\\u2019 and claimed that both were \\u2018enemies to knowledge\\u2019. The unifying theme of Chesterfield\\u2019s thoughts on this vice was that the failure to pay attention corroded social hierarchy and the moral order. In fact, the culture of the Enlightenment celebrated attention as the most important mental faculty for the exercise of reason. The historian Michael Hagner argued in \\u2018Toward a History of Attention in Culture and Science\\u2019 (2003) that, by the end of the 18th century, \\u2018attention became more than a proper metaphor for enlightened ambitions\\u2019. It was also perceived as the medium of education as well as of spiritual and moral development. The French philosopher Claude Adrien Helv\\u00e9tius regarded attention as an important source of enlightenment. In De l\\u2019esprit, or, Essays on the Mind, and its Several Faculties (1758), he associated \\u2018continued attention\\u2019 with \\u2018superior intellects\\u2019. However, unlike most other admirers of attention, this radical atheist thinker was critical of society\\u2019s tendency to condemn inattention as a moral vice. \\u2018Of what importance is it to be incessantly representing their inattention as a crime?\\u2019 he asked, before rejecting this ritual of moral control. Those who suffer this debilitating condition have a particular name for the state of their feelings: \\u2018they have the fidgets\\u2019 Attention was promoted as a moral accomplishment that was essential to the cultivation of a sound character. The philosopher Thomas Reid, the foremost exponent of 18th-century Scottish \\u2018common sense\\u2019, argued in his Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind (1788) that \\u2018there are moral rules respecting the attention\\u2019 which are \\u2018no less evident than mathematical axioms\\u2019. The moral rules of attention required cultivation and training and it was the job of educators to ensure that the young were protected from acquiring the \\u2018habits of inattention\\u2019. Inattention was increasingly perceived as an obstacle to the socialisation of young people. Countering the habit of inattention among children and young people became the central concern of pedagogy in the 18th century. Educators have always been preoccupied with gaining children\\u2019s attention but in the 18th century this concern acquired an unprecedented importance. Attention was seen as important for the nourishment of the reasoning mind as well as for spiritual and moral development. Advice books directed at parents, such as Maria Edgeworth\\u2019s Practical Education (1798), insisted that the cultivation of concentration and attention required effort and skill. Amid celebration of attention as a virtue, educators, religious commentators and medical professionals constantly expressed fears about the moral harms of inattention. From the later 18th century onwards, anxieties about the \\u2018habit of inattention\\u2019 were increasingly represented as a moral disease. In his medical textbook of 1775, the German physician Melchior Adam Weikard diagnosed the condition of what he termed \\u2018lack of attention\\u2019 (Attentio Volubilis or Mangel der Aufmerksamkeit). His description continually shifted between medical and moral deficits. According to Weikard, inattentive people lacked the stability and moral fibre necessary for concentration. They were \\u2018characterised as unwary, careless, flighty and bacchanal\\u2019. They were portrayed as relatively immature, reckless and unreliable. Weikard believed that poor childrearing practices were a source of the disease of inattention and that the condition was more common among the young than among older people. To cure the inattentive mind, he offered an 18th-century variant of character-training. He prescribed sour milk, steel powder and horseback riding. The first text dealing with the disease of inattention in the English language was Alexander Crichton\\u2019s An Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Mental Derangement (1798). Crichton saw the disorder of inattention as \\u2018belonging to the domain of medicine\\u2019 but one that was influenced by social and cultural factors. He claimed that attention could be adversely affected by poor education, lack of motivation and family influences. Both habitual inattention as well as the extreme overuse of attention could weaken the capacity to concentrate to the point that it became a medical illness. Crichton asserted that those who suffered attention deficit were agitated by an \\u2018unnatural degree of mental restlessness\\u2019. He wrote that those who suffer this debilitating condition have a \\u2018particular name for the state of their\\u2026 feelings\\u2019; they \\u2018say they have the fidgets\\u2019. During the 19th century, the state of inattention became thoroughly moralised. Inattentiveness was perceived as a threat to industrial progress, scientific advance and prosperity. The Scottish political economist William Playfair summed up the prevailing consensus on this subject when he said that: The degradation of moral character; the loss of attention to the first principles to which a society owes its prosperity and safety, both of which accompany wealth, are most powerful agents in the decline of nations.Playfair even claimed that that in France \\u2018the inattention of the nobility to their duty was one cause of the revolution\\u2019. By the end of the 19th century, inattention served as a marker for racial degeneration. In his fin-de-si\\u00e8cle classic Degeneration (1895), the social critic Max Nordau warned that \\u2018Untended and unrestrained by attention, the brain activity of the degenerate and hysterical is capricious, and without aim or purpose.\\u2019 In fact, until the 1970s, when the legitimate medical diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, or ADD, entered the mainstream vernacular and was used to understand a sub-group with a real disability, the widespread social condition of inattention tended to be represented principally as one of defective moral control. George Still\\u2019s pioneering lectures on \\u2018Some Abnormal Psychical Conditions in Children\\u2019 (1902) focused on such negative traits as \\u2018spitefulness-cruelty, jealousy, lawlessness, dishonesty, wanton mischievousness-destructiveness, shamelessness-immodesty, sexual immorality, and viciousness\\u2019. The hold of this sentiment has never gone away. Indeed, it underpins Maggie Jackson\\u2019s Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age (2008) with its claims that attention \\u2018tames our inner beast\\u2019 and is \\u2018integral to developing a conscience\\u2019. The recent decades have seen a dramatic reversal in the conceptualisation of inattention. Unlike in the 18th century when it was perceived as abnormal, today inattention is often presented as the normal state. The current era is frequently characterised as the Age of Distraction, and inattention is no longer depicted as a condition that afflicts a few. Nowadays, the erosion of humanity\\u2019s capacity for attention is portrayed as an existential problem, linked with the allegedly corrosive effects of digitally driven streams of information relentlessly flowing our way. \\u2018The net seizes our attention only to scatter it,\\u2019 contends Nicholas Carr in The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the Way We Read, Think and Remember (2010). According to the US neuroscientist Daniel Levitin, the distractions of the modern world can literally damage our brains. Yet the moral concerns that have always underpinned society\\u2019s preoccupation with inattention still lurk in the background. As the US literary critic Sven Birkerts recently acknowledged: \\u2018What I do know is that the words attention and moral came together for me with an electric immediacy.\\u2019 To any historian, this makes sense. Throughout its history, inattention has served as a sublimated focus for apprehensions about moral authority. That it was discovered in the 18th century is not surprising. The intellectual temper of the Age of Reason rejected the sacred truths of tradition and insisted that arguments should be based on evidence and reason. Helv\\u00e9tius fervently believed that everyone had the potential to acquire \\u2018continued attention\\u2019 and \\u2018triumph over indolence\\u2019 As teachers throughout history know, gaining the attention of young people is always a challenge. But once moral authority over the young became subject to a tug-of-war, the question of who would gain their attention became a pressing matter. That is one reason why moral philosophers were drawn to the problem of inattention. This was a point recognised by John Dewey in \\u2018The Psychology of Effort\\u2019 (1897), in which he noted that we become aware of attention when society is faced with competing claims for it. So although inattention is represented as the polar opposite of attention, it is more useful to perceive the issue of distraction as a concern about people not attending to what is represented as the legitimate focus of attention. It also expresses the fear that the inattentive might be paying far too much attention to the wrong texts and cultural practices. This point is recognised by Sherry Turkle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the human relationship to the world online. There is a lot \\u2018at stake in attention\\u2019, she wrote in Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in the Digital Age (2015), because \\u2018where we put it\\u2019 is \\u2018how we show what we value\\u2019. The perception of an Age of Distraction is related to our uncertainty about the answer to the question of \\u2018attention to what or to whom\\u2019. The sublimation of anxieties about moral authority through the fetish of technologically driven distraction has acquired pathological proportions in relation to children and young people. Yet as most sensible observers understand, children who are inattentive to their teachers are often obsessively attentive to the text messages that they receive. The constant lament about inattentive youth in the Anglo-American world could be interpreted as a symptom of problems related to the exercise of adult authority. Often the failure to inspire and capture the imagination of young people is blamed on their inattentive state of minds. Too often educators have responded to this condition by adopting a fatalistic approach of accommodating to the supposed inattentive reading practices of digital natives. This pattern is evident in higher education where the assumption that college students can no longer be expected to read long and challenging texts or pay attention to serious lectures has led to the adaptation of course material to the inattentive mentality of the digital native. Calls to change the educational environment to \\u2018fit the student\\u2019 have become widespread in higher education. How different from the reaction of moral philosophers such as Dugald Stewart, also concerned with the problem of the inattentive student. Author of Outlines of Moral Philosophy: For the Use of Students in the University of Edinburgh (1793), Stewart believed that the problem of inattention could be overcome through moral education. Unlike some contemporary academics, he regarded the \\u2018early habit of inattention\\u2019 a problem to be solved rather than an unalterable fact of existence. Helv\\u00e9tius fervently believed that everyone had the potential to acquire \\u2018continued attention\\u2019 and \\u2018triumph over indolence\\u2019. Regrettably, the optimism of Helv\\u00e9tius has given way to a mood of resignation. Attention is still seen as desirable but almost impossible to achieve. As one such alarmist account warns (see earlier), \\u2018an epidemic erosion of attention is a sure sign of an impending dark age\\u2019. Helv\\u00e9tius would have been distressed by the fatalism expressed in this lament. \",\n          \"The easy question came first, a few months after my son turned four: \\u2018Are we real?\\u2019 It was abrupt, but not quite out of nowhere, and I was able to answer quickly. Yes, we\\u2019re real \\u2013 but Elsa and Anna, two characters from Frozen, are not. Done. Then there was a follow-up a few weeks later that came just as abruptly, while splashing around a pool: \\u2018Daddy, why are we real?\\u2019 I don\\u2019t have a ready answer this time, partly because I don\\u2019t really understand the question. Four-year-olds ask Why? a lot \\u2013 the stereotype is true, maybe even an understatement \\u2013 and they use Why? ambiguously. Like little Aristotles with their legs dangling from their car seats, their Whys are \\u2018said in many different ways\\u2019. Sometimes these Whys even fall under neat, Aristotelian types: they might be asking what the point of something is, or how it\\u2019s made, or even asking for a criterion. Usually, you can feel your way by context. But sometimes, like now, I have no idea what my son is asking me to explain. He\\u2019s learning about the world, and learning how to ask questions about it at the same time, so there are at least two moving targets. My only clue so far is that he previously wondered whether he was real, which made it sound like he was trying to sort things into real and not-real. So maybe the follow-up is a request for a definition: What makes something real? What distinguishes the real things from the unreal ones? If so, this could be a bit awkward. \\u2018Why\\u2019-questions at their most straightforward correspond to \\u2018Because\\u2019-answers, where the \\u2018because\\u2019 refers to something other than what we\\u2019re trying to explain. You\\u2019re cranky because you haven\\u2019t eaten; we\\u2019re driving because we need to get food; this food is healthy because it has the nutrients you need. But when the question is \\u2018Why am I real?\\u2019, what other thing is there to fill in the blank after \\u2018because\\u2019? I have a professional interest in this query. The notion of reality is one of the most basic and most abstract ones we have. Raising questions about the very idea of what\\u2019s real has led to some of the most important, classic work in philosophy \\u2013 from Parmenides to Aristotle to Avicenna to Aquinas to Immanuel Kant. It also, however, has a tendency to produce the kind of frustrating, easily caricatured work that leads people \\u2013 including many philosophers \\u2013 to wonder whether certain questions are simply pointless or even illegitimate, and to adopt a kind of skeptical stance towards abstract questions in general. That attitude can be helpfully critical, but it can also be facile and self-stultifying, and it likes to masquerade as pragmatic good sense. So how does that kind of question get started? It\\u2019s easy enough to notice when a child starts confronting questions about good and bad, right and wrong. That\\u2019s one reason for thinking that these questions have good credentials. But when, if ever, does reality itself become an object of curiosity, or puzzlement, or wonder \\u2013 and why? Just as there are multiple ways of asking or answering the question Why?, there are surprisingly many ways of distinguishing what\\u2019s real from what isn\\u2019t. One of the most familiar contrasts we draw is between reality and appearance. The distinction is at least as old as philosophy, and often we say that\\u2019s about when it started \\u2013 proto-philosophers and proto-scientists of the 6th and 5th century BCE such as Thales, Anaxagoras, Empedocles and Leucippus making assertions about the fundamental reality underlying natural phenomena: the basic elements, atoms, or even numbers, if we can trust what we\\u2019ve heard about Pythagoras. Here we get the origin of the thought that what things are made of is what\\u2019s real (or \\u2018really real\\u2019, as we say when we\\u2019re at a loss for how to describe it), whereas the familiar objects at the human scale are somehow of lesser status. We just contrasted reality with appearance, but at least a table is thought to be derived from something real, insofar as it\\u2019s constituted of matter. At its most fundamental, matter might not really be the way it appears to us, but it\\u2019s really there, and it really does appear a certain way. Its appearance, we might say, is the way it manifests itself. In a different way, though, reality is sometimes contrasted with what we might call mere appearance, like the motion we create on screens: pixels are turning on and off, and changing colour, so there\\u2019s change going on, but nothing that seems to be moving really is. This is different again from the kind of illusion of motion we get from certain patterns: here there\\u2019s no change in the object at all, but still an appearance of motion. So there are at least three types of things that might be contrasted as appearance rather than reality: manifestations, mere appearances, and illusions. Of course, a bed isn\\u2019t a boat, no matter how many pieces of string or scarves you drape around it We also distinguish the following: what\\u2019s real from what\\u2019s merely imagined or dreamt; the essential nature of things (what they \\u2018really\\u2019 are) from their contingent attributes; what has existed at least at some time from what never has. Dinosaurs and ancestors are real in this last sense, but unicorns aren\\u2019t. There are even more ways we distinguish some things as real and others as unreal \\u2013 at least a dozen by my count. Reality itself might be solid, but the word is mush. So far, though, none of these distinctions seem to get quite what might be bothering my son. In terms of how we grow up, maybe the one I\\u2019m being asked about is more basic. For a four-year-old, real is usually contrasted, not with what\\u2019s derivative, or with illusion, or non-existence, but with pretend or make-believe. It\\u2019s a distinction that seems too obvious to be worth noticing for an adult \\u2013 of course, a bed isn\\u2019t a boat, no matter how many pieces of string or scarves you drape around it. As Plato saw, though, it\\u2019s urgent for us to see how the distinction behaves in the presence of children. After all, children learn a lot by pretending, and they use make-believe to get a grip on what they experience. In turn, this sort of play is closely connected to the whole realm of stories we hear and watch, as opposed to the ones we act out ourselves. The philosopher Kendall Walton has even argued that we should understand our adult relationship to narrative artworks, such as novels and films, as a sophisticated version of childhood games of make-believe, so that the characters in the stories function as \\u2018props\\u2019. (The connection itself, as he notes, has been made before, going back at least to the Austrian-born historian E H Gombrich.) A huge amount of what children come to experience or notice in their first few years are things we introduce to them through pictures and stories \\u2013 from objects and animals to things such as work, conflict, daydreaming, fear, safety and more. We use images and stories to prepare them for reality, and that preparation influences how they confront it. At least, so we imagine, so we hope, and so we worry. Plato is worried (and hopeful) too. Perhaps surprisingly, he groups stories with music and the other arts for the purposes of education, and thinks that we need to be very careful which ones we tell the future rulers of his ideal city in the Republic: Don\\u2019t you understand that we first tell stories to children? These are false, on the whole, though they have some truth in them \\u2026 You know, don\\u2019t you, that the beginning of any process is most important, especially for anything young and tender? It\\u2019s at that time that it is most malleable and takes on any pattern one wishes to impress on it.Plato thinks that the malleability in this case has a distinct source: the young can\\u2019t distinguish the allegorical or non-literal meaning of a story from its surface meaning. His solution \\u2013 censorship \\u2013 is notorious, and can sound radical, but in some degree or other almost everyone accepts his statement of the problem, and some version of his solution. Unless he\\u2019s prepared in the right way, a child won\\u2019t even recognise why something is good But it\\u2019s important to see why Plato thinks we need these early stories that are \\u2018false on the whole, but contain some truth\\u2019. The general goal of all this early exposure to the right kind of stories, music and art isn\\u2019t any literal transmission of information, but rather that \\u2018something of those fine works will strike their eyes and ears like a breeze that brings health from a good place, leading them unwittingly, from childhood on, to resemblance, friendship, and harmony with the beauty of reason\\u2019. The result is that anyone who has been properly educated in music and poetry will sense it acutely when something has been omitted from a thing and when it hasn\\u2019t been finely crafted or finely made by nature \\u2026 He\\u2019ll rightly object to what is shameful, hating it while he\\u2019s still young and unable to grasp the reason, but, having been educated in this way, he will welcome the reason when it comes and recognise it easily because of its kinship with himself.A child being educated isn\\u2019t yet able to understand the reason why something is bad or good, shameful or noble. And yet, we can\\u2019t wait to start orienting him towards some things and away from others: by the time he\\u2019s ready to understand why some things are good and some bad, it\\u2019ll be too late to make him find the right behaviours and actions attractive. In fact, unless he\\u2019s already prepared in the right way emotionally, he won\\u2019t even recognise the reasons why something is good when they\\u2019re right in front of him. This aesthetic-emotional preparation then is what makes later rational appreciation possible. It can work because children can be influenced, Plato thinks, by allegorical content and aesthetic properties, but this very susceptibility also makes the whole thing risky. Any parent who has overthought what stories to tell, what music to play, how to decorate a child\\u2019s room or what toys to have around will recognise this kind of fear and hope. For Plato, though, the crucial part is that the relation between these stories and artworks has a special role that plays on their two aspects: as images, they characterise our early ignorance, but in early childhood they are also one of the only ways to reach us. At their best, they are not mere images or stories but intimations, however attenuated, of something all-important we are not yet ready to grasp. Let\\u2019s grant then that the distinction between reality and make-believe is pervasive and important in childhood. Still, what on Earth is there for a four-year-old to be puzzled about? And how to explain it in a way that will satisfy one? I could say: \\u2018You have a body, but Elsa doesn\\u2019t.\\u2019 (I suspect that, for a lot of grownups, this is the obvious answer.) Elsa wears dresses, though, and you need a body for that, so I can\\u2019t say her body isn\\u2019t real without begging the question. That\\u2019s a foul but, more importantly, it means exactly what the phrase says. The question comes right back again. I could point to origins: Elsa was made up by someone \\u2013 invented \\u2013 whereas my son was made by us. This isn\\u2019t promising either though, since it looks like I\\u2019m just saying he and Elsa were made in different ways. And how does one sort of making result in something that\\u2019s real, while another sort results in something that isn\\u2019t? Question-begging, again. I should start over, with the notion of pretending. There\\u2019s actually a big difference between saying that the couch is a pretend-boat, the kind of thing he\\u2019s been doing for a while, and this newer business of saying that a character is just pretend. He\\u2019s used to seeing pictures and videos, and he goes back and forth between images and descriptions of real things, on the one hand, and images and stories about imaginary things, on the other, without any real warning. He\\u2019s been doing both of those things for a long time now \\u2013 absorbing images and stories, and playing make-believe \\u2013 but he\\u2019s been doing them separately. Now we\\u2019re asking him to combine those two notions, and accept that some pictures and stories \\u2013 vivid sequences of moving images depicting moving, talking people \\u2013 are just make-believe, and in some sense aren\\u2019t really of anything the way that others are. Some images tell us about what\\u2019s real, and some are just pictures. I can see that being puzzling. How to explain the difference? I could talk about how animation is made, as opposed to photographs, but I doubt he\\u2019d understand it from a description. That isn\\u2019t really relevant, either, since other kinds of image can be trustworthy, and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to teach a child today that photographs have any special authority. A well-crafted story can affect us whether or not we think it\\u2019s actually true The problem, which I can\\u2019t quite explain to him, is that you can\\u2019t tell from the image itself which kind it is. Unless an image depicts an impossibility, it could be an image of reality, and any image, no matter how \\u2018realistic\\u2019, might be a mere image. (The same goes, perhaps even more disturbingly, for stories.) He\\u2019ll just have to learn by experience which images and stories to trust, and how much to trust them \\u2013 and even then, sometimes he\\u2019ll be fooled. If that\\u2019s what he\\u2019s confused about, he\\u2019s perfectly right to be. Indeed, in a later dialogue, the Sophist, Plato locates the nature and danger of sophistry precisely in terms of the sophist\\u2019s ability to create appearances that are in some sense merely \\u2018images\\u2019 (eid\\u00f4la), rather than \\u2018likenesses\\u2019 (eikones), and is compelled to work out how \\u2018what is not\\u2019 can be woven together with \\u2018what is\\u2019 in order to make sense of the idea. Plato was right: images and stories are two-faced. We need them to learn our way around the world when we\\u2019re completely helpless in it, well before we have any idea what we\\u2019re learning, or why it\\u2019s important. No wonder we trust them, and no wonder they\\u2019re an especially soft target for exploitation. We need to trust them \\u2013 and we must suspect them. Plato was right again: not knowing how to deal with images is a basis for personal and political disaster. A well-crafted story can affect us whether or not we think it\\u2019s actually true, since by default \\u2013 in fact, by training \\u2013 we trust them without thinking that they must meet ordinary standards of literal truth. It\\u2019s a lesson we relearn every day, startling ourselves with our own gullibility, and living with the consequences. From this perspective, it seems naive to think that we could fight the influence of lies and bubbles on social media with a thumbs-down button, or a \\u2018trustworthiness indicator\\u2019, or even classes in critical thinking. If we hope to find remotely plausible solutions, we should recognise how deep the problem runs. How, then, can I give a good answer, if the question is about what\\u2019s real and what\\u2019s pretend? I suppose the right answer has something do with the fact that trustworthy images are causally connected to their subjects in the right ways, and carry information about them because of these causal connections, but I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re ready for that. I settle for something a bit simpler: he can do whatever he decides to do, but Elsa can do only what happens in the story. It\\u2019s not great, but it\\u2019s a positive message. It works for now. But wait. Did I even address my son\\u2019s actual question, or was I responding to a projected image of my own? Did the philosophy professor \\u2013 just this once, of course \\u2013 overthink it? I still don\\u2019t know really, and never will. My son is only four, and by the time he\\u2019s able to explain what he means by Why?, he\\u2019ll have forgotten what puzzled him \\u2013 if he hasn\\u2019t already. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

In fact, one of the great shifts of modernity has been how mathematicians changed their view of mathematics, transforming the focus of their work from the study of the natural world to the study of ideas and concepts. Andr\\u00e9 Weil led the first meeting of the Bourbaki group. And there\\u2019s the extraordinary career of Emmy Noether, who made contributions across many fields of mathematics and physics, and helped to apply abstract algebra to topology (which deals with the preservation of spatial properties during transformations of shape and size, and is one of the main ways topology is done today). Obviously, one\\u2019s actual rank depends on skill and talent \\u2013 if you did well the first time, you probably are pretty fast \\u2013 but each result also depends on luck as well as a host of other circumstances. Elementary proofs are nothing if not ways to think about something in all applicable cases so that repetitive testing on each possibility is not necessary. In the words of the 19th-century German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss: \\u2018mathematics is the queen of the sciences\\u2019; like literacy, widespread numeracy is one of the defining features of modernity. Does it get me closer to the heart of the matter?\\u2019 And like most pieces of art, truly appreciating it is not a rote exercise: \\u2018works of mathematics are subject to critical appraisal; that one can have and develop mathematical taste\\u2019. Those wishing to lend certainty and authority to their ideologies use mathematics, but they also abuse it. All things being equal, the next time around, you\\u2019re actually not likely to do as well, relative to the other runners. Taking mathematics seriously might also, counter to stereotypes, lead thinking away from current preoccupations with culture and power, and back to questions of aesthetics and beauty. But one of the most important reasons for the rise of the modern state is the increasing possible reach of politicians and bureaucrats, changes powerfully facilitated by improvements in mathematics and technology, and that are absent in both of their accounts. In other words, the more trials, the less random or mistaken the measure. Superficially, they are unlike each other in almost every way, from their prose style, to their subjects. Finally, taking mathematical ideas seriously might lead to discovering that technical ideas are as important as political or religious ones. Yet, when people invoke the history of ideas, you are unlikely to hear about Dedekind\\u2019s cut (that is, the technique by which the real numbers are rigorously defined from the rational numbers), or L E J Brouwer\\u2019s rejection of Aristotle\\u2019s \\u2018law of excluded middle\\u2019, which states that any proposition is either true or that its negation is (put technically: for all propositions p, either p or not p). This is not an argument for a neo-Platonic worshipful examination of ideas, or for a move away from considerations of politics. Describing technology and mathematical modes of thought as mechanistic and alienating mistakes the result for the process. Even in number system you will find material for long reflection. \\u2018These foundations [of mathematics] are, moreover, a perpetual source of reflection and discovery for the masters of the science. Nor has this divide been one-sided. The discipline of economics offers a recent example, but this is also true for areas as widely separate as architecture and philosophy, as the political scientist and anthropologist James C Scott shows in his book Seeing Like a State: How Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition Have Failed (1999). Continuing with his literature analogy, Lockhart emphasises that: \\u2018A piece of mathematics is like a poem, and we can ask if it satisfies our aesthetic criteria: is this argument sound? The paradox, however, is that a desire to bypass repetitious exercises is precisely one of the things that motivates mathematicians. The Victorian polymath (and eugenicist) Sir Francis Galton first discovered and formulated the idea of regression to the mean in his studies of heredity. As the Oxford English Dictionary explains, regression to the mean is \\u2018the tendency for the values of any distributed variable to move towards the mean over repeated independent trials\\u2019. Nothing could be more elegant. The \\u2018regression toward mediocrity\\u2019, in Galton\\u2019s memorable phrase, grew out of his studies of why genius seemed to run through families (think of the Bachs), but then also how and why it dissipated over time. Does it make sense? If his patterns are more permanent than theirs, it is because they are made with ideas.\\u2019 What then might we all learn from better integrating the two? There are many colourful anecdotes about Andr\\u00e9 Weil\\u2019s life \\u2013 he escaped war-torn Europe and lived all around the world \\u2013 but perhaps most importantly, and amusingly, he was a founding member the Bourbaki group. It is rather a call to recognise the ways in which humans actually encounter ideas, and the unique vitality of mathematical ideas in the world. One of the main ways they tried to achieve this goal was by collectively writing textbooks under the name of a fictitious character, one Nicolas Bourbaki. However, the larger problem among historians of science is that, while the consolidation of the field over the previous century has been an institutional and economic success, it has segregated the field. Akin to the best poems, they contain truths about the world perfectly expressed. From theologians to politicians and economists, many have naively \\u2013 even manipulatively \\u2013 adopted mathematical methods to develop, and too often implement, overly simplistic theories of the world. The modern separation among scholars between intellectual history and the history of mathematics is untenable as mathematics might be the ultimate intellectual endeavour. The variability of the concept of rigour shows that something else besides mathematical abstraction must enter into the makeup of mathematics.\\u2019 While the reason that mathematics is authoritative is due of its supposed rigour and certainty, what we mean by rigour has changed throughout history, based on novel ideas and realisations. In other words, it would mean beginning to be as interested in the creators of our technological civilisation as history has been in those who lament it. The ideas that most deeply shape us, and our societies, are just as often not part of the history of political thought, but come from many other areas. In the essay \\u2018Modern Science, Metaphysics, and Mathematics\\u2019 (1962), he writes: \\u2018In the mathematical project develops an obligation to principles demanded by the mathematical itself.\\u2019 In Heidegger\\u2019s view, the embrace of mathematics and technology brings a kind of repetitious, routinised, alienating world in its wake. Today, it primarily takes place within separate departments or committees, with separate training. Recognising the role of mathematics in the history of how we think would actually make us more sophisticated in our political judgment. \\u2018Mathematics, like any literature, is created by human beings for their own amusement\\u2019 One of the many damaging results of this intellectual division is that most of us \\u2013 that is, those of us who are not mathematicians, physicists or engineers \\u2013 adopt a view of mathematics that is primarily the product of our encounter with it in grade school. Yet this is exactly the opposite of how mathematicians see their own work. Galton\\u2019s conceptual innovation, his idea of regression to the mean, made certain features of the world newly visible. As the epitome of formal knowledge and the premier example of abstract reason, the spectre of mathematics has haunted European thought for centuries. Genius and talent themselves being impossible to measure, Galton studied other more quantifiable phenomena, for instance, the height differences between parents and children, and the spatial distribution of falling objects. There are many factors that have contributed to the shortchanging of the history of mathematics and its ideas. Yet both portray intellectual history mostly in terms of political languages and expressions of power. Despite the repeated problems with this approach, the impulse has been seminal, formative and comparatively neglected. There\\u2019s Shannon and his insights into information theory, along with his teacher, the prodigy Norbert Wiener, who coined the term \\u2018cybernetics\\u2019 (and wrote a scintillating two-volume autobiography). The history of ideas can, should and, historically, has often been precisely about the limitations of politics and the rewards of other ideas; it need not primarily be the study of thinkers who, more often than not, never even directly held power. This reinforces, in practice and effect, a division between the study of science and the study of society \\u2013 something its own literature repeatedly criticises. Take, for example, the case of the Weils: Simone Weil was an important literary and political writer, regarded as one of the more insightful religious philosophers and social critics of the first half of the 20th century; her brother Andr\\u00e9, a mathematician, made important contributions to a variety of areas of mathematics, but is much less widely known, unless one is a mathematician. The notion of regression to the mean informs how we think about a wide range of things, from the design of clinical trials, to gambling, to, well, the prosaic pep-talks we give ourselves after coming up short by saying: \\u2018OK, next time will be better.\\u2019 Actually, it probably will be. By doing so, he helped us count and describe other things we can\\u2019t see, or test, but that shape our lives. Commenting on the aftermath of the late 19th- and early 20th-century controversy over the foundations of his subject, the influential mathematician John von Neumann wrote in the essay The Mathematician (1947) that \\u2018[T]he very concept of \\u201cabsolute\\u201d mathematical rigour is not immutable. And Weil is just the beginning. For most people, unfortunately, mathematics is a set of confusing, repetitive, formalistic and abstract techniques. The British scholar Quentin Skinner and the French philosopher Michel Foucault, for example, are arguably the most influential intellectual historians of the past 50 years. This was a loose association of mostly French mathematicians in the first half of the 20th century who tried to put mathematics on a new and self-contained basis (a recurring goal in the history of mathematics and, more generally, the history of thought). The allure of formal schemes has turned people\\u2019s attention to the results of mathematics, rather than to the creative ways that mathematicians work and think. For instance, this essay was written on a computer. The discourses and mentalities of individuals, for both of them, describe much of the social and political world, and account for when and why change happens. We should not understand the history of ideas as one besotted by speculations about politics. What might be gained if, to quote Egon Spengler in the film Ghostbusters (1984), \\u2018we cross the streams\\u2019 of the history of mathematics and the history of ideas? As the historian John Tresch recently noted: \\u2018For most historians of science trained in the past 30 years, doing history of science has meant avoiding the history of ideas.\\u2019 Even though most historians of science would surely consider the history of mathematics part of their field, in fact the subject is more often conspicuous by its absence than its presence. How mathematics works rests on no absolute timeless standard, despite what many assume today, given its precision and efficacy. But perhaps this is both too obvious and too slight an example. Generally, when they talk about ideas, intellectual historians today mean political thought, cultural analysis, and maybe a sprinkling of economic and religious concepts, too. High among them is how narrowly political the work of leading intellectual historians has been. By teaching mathematics as a series of techniques, the appeal and nature of mathematics is masked: \\u2018Of course there\\u2019s no criticism going on in school \\u2013 there\\u2019s no art being done to criticise!\\u2019 The notable English mathematician G H Hardy also compared mathematics to poetry in his own work A Mathematician\\u2019s Apology (1940): \\u2018A mathematician, like a painter or a poet, is a maker of patterns. Is it simple and elegant? In order to be able to see just where you actually place or rank, you have to be able to know the shape or form of the distribution of outcomes. You do surprisingly well and beat most of your classmates. There\\u2019s the debates between Brouwer and David Hilbert about the basis of mathematics. Aesthetics and beauty are ever-present concerns in art and in mathematics, though seemingly small matters to historians and humanists today, preoccupied as they are with power. Rather, what attracts them, in the words of The Mathematics Lover\\u2019s Companion (2017) by the graph theorist Ed Scheinerman, are \\u2018joyful, beautiful\\u2019 theorems and proofs, which they arrive at through the sweat of intellectual play. Bourbaki doesn\\u2019t exist, but he published not a few books, and came up with some of the terms and symbols modern mathematicians use, such as \\u00d8 to represent the empty set. Let\\u2019s take something more basic and widespread, something most of us probably already apprehend, even if only dimly \\u2013 like the idea of regression to the mean. Perhaps the most impassioned remonstration against our bifurcated view of mathematics is the pamphlet A Mathematician\\u2019s Lament (2009) by the American private-school teacher Paul Lockhart. For instance, say you\\u2019re in a race at school. With that, hopefully, we can gain a wider sense of the diverse ideas and visions that, deep down (for better and for worse), motivate and inform any of our endeavours. Taking mathematics seriously might lead thinking back to questions of aesthetics and beauty In some ways, mathematics is the hardest, and most realistic, art. \\u2018At no time are students let in on the secret that mathematics, like any literature, is created by human beings for their own amusement,\\u2019 Lockhart writes, attempting to humanise the subject. Nor are you likely to hear about the contested history of these ideas. He devised a contraption called the Quincunx, and found that when uniformly dropped objects encountered small deviations (think of a pinball machine with lots of stoppers), they nevertheless distributed themselves at the bottom along a normal distribution \\u2013 what we generally call a bell curve. Perhaps more than any other subject, mathematics is about the study of ideas. Written in 2002 and circulated for years among mathematicians and educators, Lockhart\\u2019s essay ruthlessly criticised the simplistic nature of most mandatory mathematics education. Mathematics, Lockhart wrote, is almost always taught in a way to obscure the actual insights and reasoning, the grandeur and insight, the excitement and frustration, that drive mathematicians. Intellectual history today is dominated by elite political ideas. The software of the computer, its mind and spirit, if you will, is a compilation of code that is based on the ideas of Claude Shannon, the father of information theory, and his article \\u2018A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\u2019 (1948). The German philosopher Martin Heidegger, for instance, offers an example of an influential thinker who misrepresented mathematics as a kind of thinking divorced from the natural world. Therefore, in order to mitigate against any selection effect, one has to run the experiment multiple times. The bell curve, of course, is just one example of the various forms used to plot the relationship among independent and dependent variables. Remember that Leibniz did not disdain to occupy himself with it.\\u2019 \\u2013 Paul Val\\u00e9ry, letter to Pierre Honnorat, 1942There are almost too many examples of the power and pervasiveness of mathematical ideas.  The personal computer is hardly an essential part of human The personal computer is hardly an essential part of human The personal computer is hardly an essential part of human\",\n          \"It is important to note that, According to Weikard, inattentive people lacked the stability and moral fibre necessary for concentration. Beattie associated inattention with \\u2018unkindness and dissatisfaction\\u2019 and warned that if this vice was allowed to flourish, social order would be undermined. Helv\\u00e9tius would have been distressed by the fatalism expressed in this lament. The Oxford English Dictionary cites a 1710 entry from Tatler as its first reference to this word, coupling inattention with indolence; both are represented as moral vices of serious public concern. Regrettably, the optimism of Helv\\u00e9tius has given way to a mood of resignation. The historian Michael Hagner argued in \\u2018Toward a History of Attention in Culture and Science\\u2019 (2003) that, by the end of the 18th century, \\u2018attention became more than a proper metaphor for enlightened ambitions\\u2019. As the US literary critic Sven Birkerts recently acknowledged: \\u2018What I do know is that the words attention and moral came together for me with an electric immediacy.\\u2019 To any historian, this makes sense. The unifying theme of Chesterfield\\u2019s thoughts on this vice was that the failure to pay attention corroded social hierarchy and the moral order. Weikard believed that poor childrearing practices were a source of the disease of inattention and that the condition was more common among the young than among older people. The French philosopher Claude Adrien Helv\\u00e9tius regarded attention as an important source of enlightenment. The moral rules of attention required cultivation and training and it was the job of educators to ensure that the young were protected from acquiring the \\u2018habits of inattention\\u2019. Crichton saw the disorder of inattention as \\u2018belonging to the domain of medicine\\u2019 but one that was influenced by social and cultural factors. It was also perceived as the medium of education as well as of spiritual and moral development. There is a lot \\u2018at stake in attention\\u2019, she wrote in Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in the Digital Age (2015), because \\u2018where we put it\\u2019 is \\u2018how we show what we value\\u2019. During the 19th century, the state of inattention became thoroughly moralised. One of the most widely cited 18th-century sources of advice on the problem of inattention was The Elements of a Polite Education: Carefully Selected from the Letters of the Late Honourable Philip Dormer Stanhope, Earl of Chesterfield, to his Son (1774). By the end of the 19th century, inattention served as a marker for racial degeneration. The recent decades have seen a dramatic reversal in the conceptualisation of inattention. Too often educators have responded to this condition by adopting a fatalistic approach of accommodating to the supposed inattentive reading practices of digital natives. Inattention was increasingly perceived as an obstacle to the socialisation of young people. Yet the moral concerns that have always underpinned society\\u2019s preoccupation with inattention still lurk in the background. How different from the reaction of moral philosophers such as Dugald Stewart, also concerned with the problem of the inattentive student. The constant lament about inattentive youth in the Anglo-American world could be interpreted as a symptom of problems related to the exercise of adult authority. The philosopher Thomas Reid, the foremost exponent of 18th-century Scottish \\u2018common sense\\u2019, argued in his Essays on the Active Powers of the Human Mind (1788) that \\u2018there are moral rules respecting the attention\\u2019 which are \\u2018no less evident than mathematical axioms\\u2019. The current era is frequently characterised as the Age of Distraction, and inattention is no longer depicted as a condition that afflicts a few. Often the failure to inspire and capture the imagination of young people is blamed on their inattentive state of minds. The Scottish political economist William Playfair summed up the prevailing consensus on this subject when he said that: The degradation of moral character; the loss of attention to the first principles to which a society owes its prosperity and safety, both of which accompany wealth, are most powerful agents in the decline of nations.Playfair even claimed that that in France \\u2018the inattention of the nobility to their duty was one cause of the revolution\\u2019. As one such alarmist account warns (see earlier), \\u2018an epidemic erosion of attention is a sure sign of an impending dark age\\u2019. The rise of the internet and the widespread availability of digital technology has surrounded us with endless sources of distraction: texts, emails and Instagrams from friends, streaming music and videos, ever-changing stock quotes, news and more news. Inattentiveness was perceived as a threat to industrial progress, scientific advance and prosperity. In England, 18th-century literary commentators such as Richard Steele, a founder of The Guardian, and the essayist and moralist Samuel Johnson regarded inattention as a symptom of an \\u2018undetermined manner of thinking\\u2019. This point is recognised by Sherry Turkle of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies the human relationship to the world online. This was a point recognised by John Dewey in \\u2018The Psychology of Effort\\u2019 (1897), in which he noted that we become aware of attention when society is faced with competing claims for it. Countering the habit of inattention among children and young people became the central concern of pedagogy in the 18th century. Unlike in the 18th century when it was perceived as abnormal, today inattention is often presented as the normal state. In fact, the culture of the Enlightenment celebrated attention as the most important mental faculty for the exercise of reason. \\u2018Of what importance is it to be incessantly representing their inattention as a crime?\\u2019 he asked, before rejecting this ritual of moral control. They were portrayed as relatively immature, reckless and unreliable. Educators have always been preoccupied with gaining children\\u2019s attention but in the 18th century this concern acquired an unprecedented importance. In his fin-de-si\\u00e8cle classic Degeneration (1895), the social critic Max Nordau warned that \\u2018Untended and unrestrained by attention, the brain activity of the degenerate and hysterical is capricious, and without aim or purpose.\\u2019 In fact, until the 1970s, when the legitimate medical diagnosis of attention deficit disorder, or ADD, entered the mainstream vernacular and was used to understand a sub-group with a real disability, the widespread social condition of inattention tended to be represented principally as one of defective moral control. The intellectual temper of the Age of Reason rejected the sacred truths of tradition and insisted that arguments should be based on evidence and reason. That is one reason why moral philosophers were drawn to the problem of inattention. The perception of an Age of Distraction is related to our uncertainty about the answer to the question of \\u2018attention to what or to whom\\u2019. Crichton asserted that those who suffered attention deficit were agitated by an \\u2018unnatural degree of mental restlessness\\u2019. Nowadays, the erosion of humanity\\u2019s capacity for attention is portrayed as an existential problem, linked with the allegedly corrosive effects of digitally driven streams of information relentlessly flowing our way. Yet as most sensible observers understand, children who are inattentive to their teachers are often obsessively attentive to the text messages that they receive. Some people think that our willpower is so weak because our brains have been damaged by digital noise. Philosophers and moralists at the forefront of cultural construction characterised the \\u2018habit of inattention\\u2019 as not simply a stand-alone moral failing but the source of other vices. So although inattention is represented as the polar opposite of attention, it is more useful to perceive the issue of distraction as a concern about people not attending to what is represented as the legitimate focus of attention. In his medical textbook of 1775, the German physician Melchior Adam Weikard diagnosed the condition of what he termed \\u2018lack of attention\\u2019 (Attentio Volubilis or Mangel der Aufmerksamkeit). The first time inattention emerged as a social threat was in 18th-century Europe, during the Enlightenment, just as logic and science were pushing against religion and myth. To get our work done, we could try to turn off the digital stream, but that\\u2019s difficult to do when we\\u2019re plagued by FOMO, the modern fear of missing out. That it was discovered in the 18th century is not surprising. To cure the inattentive mind, he offered an 18th-century variant of character-training. He prescribed sour milk, steel powder and horseback riding. \\u2018The net seizes our attention only to scatter it,\\u2019 contends Nicholas Carr in The Shallows: How the Internet is Changing the Way We Read, Think and Remember (2010). He asserted that \\u2018we have contracted many evil habits, which, with proper attention, we might have avoided\\u2019. They were \\u2018characterised as unwary, careless, flighty and bacchanal\\u2019. He wrote that those who suffer this debilitating condition have a \\u2018particular name for the state of their\\u2026 feelings\\u2019; they \\u2018say they have the fidgets\\u2019. \\u2018I know no one thing more offensive to a company, than inattention and distraction,\\u2019 Chesterfield wrote in March 1746. Amid celebration of attention as a virtue, educators, religious commentators and medical professionals constantly expressed fears about the moral harms of inattention. Attention is still seen as desirable but almost impossible to achieve. Helv\\u00e9tius fervently believed that everyone had the potential to acquire \\u2018continued attention\\u2019 and \\u2018triumph over indolence\\u2019. His description continually shifted between medical and moral deficits. Author of Outlines of Moral Philosophy: For the Use of Students in the University of Edinburgh (1793), Stewart believed that the problem of inattention could be overcome through moral education. In a letter written in January 1752, he equated inattention with a \\u2018laziness of mind\\u2019 and claimed that both were \\u2018enemies to knowledge\\u2019. The first text dealing with the disease of inattention in the English language was Alexander Crichton\\u2019s An Inquiry into the Nature and Origin of Mental Derangement (1798). The hold of this sentiment has never gone away. Unlike some contemporary academics, he regarded the \\u2018early habit of inattention\\u2019 a problem to be solved rather than an unalterable fact of existence. This pattern is evident in higher education where the assumption that college students can no longer be expected to read long and challenging texts or pay attention to serious lectures has led to the adaptation of course material to the inattentive mentality of the digital native. Indeed, it underpins Maggie Jackson\\u2019s Distracted: The Erosion of Attention and the Coming Dark Age (2008) with its claims that attention \\u2018tames our inner beast\\u2019 and is \\u2018integral to developing a conscience\\u2019. In An Essay on Truth (1770), the Scottish moral philosopher James Beattie, who gained a reputation for voicing the moral anxieties of his epoch, located inattention as the source of the \\u2018criminal habits\\u2019 that \\u2018debase the moral faculty\\u2019. Throughout its history, inattention has served as a sublimated focus for apprehensions about moral authority. In De l\\u2019esprit, or, Essays on the Mind, and its Several Faculties (1758), he associated \\u2018continued attention\\u2019 with \\u2018superior intellects\\u2019. Helv\\u00e9tius fervently believed that everyone had the potential to acquire \\u2018continued attention\\u2019 and \\u2018triumph over indolence\\u2019 As teachers throughout history know, gaining the attention of young people is always a challenge. Calls to change the educational environment to \\u2018fit the student\\u2019 have become widespread in higher education. George Still\\u2019s pioneering lectures on \\u2018Some Abnormal Psychical Conditions in Children\\u2019 (1902) focused on such negative traits as \\u2018spitefulness-cruelty, jealousy, lawlessness, dishonesty, wanton mischievousness-destructiveness, shamelessness-immodesty, sexual immorality, and viciousness\\u2019. Attention was seen as important for the nourishment of the reasoning mind as well as for spiritual and moral development. Both habitual inattention as well as the extreme overuse of attention could weaken the capacity to concentrate to the point that it became a medical illness. The sublimation of anxieties about moral authority through the fetish of technologically driven distraction has acquired pathological proportions in relation to children and young people. However, unlike most other admirers of attention, this radical atheist thinker was critical of society\\u2019s tendency to condemn inattention as a moral vice. But blaming technology for the rise in inattention is misplaced. Advice books directed at parents, such as Maria Edgeworth\\u2019s Practical Education (1798), insisted that the cultivation of concentration and attention required effort and skill. But once moral authority over the young became subject to a tug-of-war, the question of who would gain their attention became a pressing matter. Those who suffer this debilitating condition have a particular name for the state of their feelings: \\u2018they have the fidgets\\u2019 Attention was promoted as a moral accomplishment that was essential to the cultivation of a sound character. It also expresses the fear that the inattentive might be paying far too much attention to the wrong texts and cultural practices. He claimed that attention could be adversely affected by poor education, lack of motivation and family influences. According to the US neuroscientist Daniel Levitin, the distractions of the modern world can literally damage our brains. History shows that the disquiet is fuelled not by the next new thing but by the threat this thing \\u2013 whatever it might be \\u2013 poses to the moral authority of the day. They offered advice on ways to counter \\u2018that hurry of mind\\u2019 to \\u2018which some busy spirits are subjected\\u2019. From the later 18th century onwards, anxieties about the \\u2018habit of inattention\\u2019 were increasingly represented as a moral disease.  According to Weikard, inattentive people lacked the stability and moral According to Weikard, inattentive people lacked the stability and moral According to Weikard, inattentive people lacked the stability and moral\",\n          \"In today's world, Dinosaurs and ancestors are real in this last sense, but unicorns aren\\u2019t.

The notion of reality is one of the most basic and most abstract ones we have. The general goal of all this early exposure to the right kind of stories, music and art isn\\u2019t any literal transmission of information, but rather that \\u2018something of those fine works will strike their eyes and ears like a breeze that brings health from a good place, leading them unwittingly, from childhood on, to resemblance, friendship, and harmony with the beauty of reason\\u2019. In a different way, though, reality is sometimes contrasted with what we might call mere appearance, like the motion we create on screens: pixels are turning on and off, and changing colour, so there\\u2019s change going on, but nothing that seems to be moving really is. Reality itself might be solid, but the word is mush. At its most fundamental, matter might not really be the way it appears to us, but it\\u2019s really there, and it really does appear a certain way. We just contrasted reality with appearance, but at least a table is thought to be derived from something real, insofar as it\\u2019s constituted of matter. If that\\u2019s what he\\u2019s confused about, he\\u2019s perfectly right to be. That attitude can be helpfully critical, but it can also be facile and self-stultifying, and it likes to masquerade as pragmatic good sense. And how to explain it in a way that will satisfy one? ambiguously. Now we\\u2019re asking him to combine those two notions, and accept that some pictures and stories \\u2013 vivid sequences of moving images depicting moving, talking people \\u2013 are just make-believe, and in some sense aren\\u2019t really of anything the way that others are. Any parent who has overthought what stories to tell, what music to play, how to decorate a child\\u2019s room or what toys to have around will recognise this kind of fear and hope. I should start over, with the notion of pretending. So maybe the follow-up is a request for a definition: What makes something real? The philosopher Kendall Walton has even argued that we should understand our adult relationship to narrative artworks, such as novels and films, as a sophisticated version of childhood games of make-believe, so that the characters in the stories function as \\u2018props\\u2019. Indeed, in a later dialogue, the Sophist, Plato locates the nature and danger of sophistry precisely in terms of the sophist\\u2019s ability to create appearances that are in some sense merely \\u2018images\\u2019 (eid\\u00f4la), rather than \\u2018likenesses\\u2019 (eikones), and is compelled to work out how \\u2018what is not\\u2019 can be woven together with \\u2018what is\\u2019 in order to make sense of the idea. Here we get the origin of the thought that what things are made of is what\\u2019s real (or \\u2018really real\\u2019, as we say when we\\u2019re at a loss for how to describe it), whereas the familiar objects at the human scale are somehow of lesser status. In turn, this sort of play is closely connected to the whole realm of stories we hear and watch, as opposed to the ones we act out ourselves. It\\u2019s not great, but it\\u2019s a positive message. I can see that being puzzling. Four-year-olds ask Why? From this perspective, it seems naive to think that we could fight the influence of lies and bubbles on social media with a thumbs-down button, or a \\u2018trustworthiness indicator\\u2019, or even classes in critical thinking. Then there was a follow-up a few weeks later that came just as abruptly, while splashing around a pool: \\u2018Daddy, why are we real?\\u2019 I don\\u2019t have a ready answer this time, partly because I don\\u2019t really understand the question. What distinguishes the real things from the unreal ones? It can work because children can be influenced, Plato thinks, by allegorical content and aesthetic properties, but this very susceptibility also makes the whole thing risky. How, then, can I give a good answer, if the question is about what\\u2019s real and what\\u2019s pretend? I could point to origins: Elsa was made up by someone \\u2013 invented \\u2013 whereas my son was made by us. Let\\u2019s grant then that the distinction between reality and make-believe is pervasive and important in childhood. Usually, you can feel your way by context. (The same goes, perhaps even more disturbingly, for stories.) He\\u2019ll just have to learn by experience which images and stories to trust, and how much to trust them \\u2013 and even then, sometimes he\\u2019ll be fooled. And yet, we can\\u2019t wait to start orienting him towards some things and away from others: by the time he\\u2019s ready to understand why some things are good and some bad, it\\u2019ll be too late to make him find the right behaviours and actions attractive. There are even more ways we distinguish some things as real and others as unreal \\u2013 at least a dozen by my count. There\\u2019s actually a big difference between saying that the couch is a pretend-boat, the kind of thing he\\u2019s been doing for a while, and this newer business of saying that a character is just pretend. But sometimes, like now, I have no idea what my son is asking me to explain. \\u2018Why\\u2019-questions at their most straightforward correspond to \\u2018Because\\u2019-answers, where the \\u2018because\\u2019 refers to something other than what we\\u2019re trying to explain. My only clue so far is that he previously wondered whether he was real, which made it sound like he was trying to sort things into real and not-real. It\\u2019s at that time that it is most malleable and takes on any pattern one wishes to impress on it.Plato thinks that the malleability in this case has a distinct source: the young can\\u2019t distinguish the allegorical or non-literal meaning of a story from its surface meaning. He\\u2019s been doing both of those things for a long time now \\u2013 absorbing images and stories, and playing make-believe \\u2013 but he\\u2019s been doing them separately. Plato was right: images and stories are two-faced. It works for now. If so, this could be a bit awkward. Question-begging, again. Of course, a bed isn\\u2019t a boat, no matter how many pieces of string or scarves you drape around it We also distinguish the following: what\\u2019s real from what\\u2019s merely imagined or dreamt; the essential nature of things (what they \\u2018really\\u2019 are) from their contingent attributes; what has existed at least at some time from what never has. In fact, unless he\\u2019s already prepared in the right way emotionally, he won\\u2019t even recognise the reasons why something is good when they\\u2019re right in front of him. Unless an image depicts an impossibility, it could be an image of reality, and any image, no matter how \\u2018realistic\\u2019, might be a mere image. This aesthetic-emotional preparation then is what makes later rational appreciation possible. These are false, on the whole, though they have some truth in them \\u2026 You know, don\\u2019t you, that the beginning of any process is most important, especially for anything young and tender? It\\u2019s easy enough to notice when a child starts confronting questions about good and bad, right and wrong. a lot \\u2013 the stereotype is true, maybe even an understatement \\u2013 and they use Why? I still don\\u2019t know really, and never will. Did the philosophy professor \\u2013 just this once, of course \\u2013 overthink it? If we hope to find remotely plausible solutions, we should recognise how deep the problem runs. It also, however, has a tendency to produce the kind of frustrating, easily caricatured work that leads people \\u2013 including many philosophers \\u2013 to wonder whether certain questions are simply pointless or even illegitimate, and to adopt a kind of skeptical stance towards abstract questions in general. That\\u2019s a foul but, more importantly, it means exactly what the phrase says. As Plato saw, though, it\\u2019s urgent for us to see how the distinction behaves in the presence of children. That isn\\u2019t really relevant, either, since other kinds of image can be trustworthy, and there\\u2019s no way I\\u2019m going to teach a child today that photographs have any special authority. Plato is worried (and hopeful) too. So how does that kind of question get started? A well-crafted story can affect us whether or not we think it\\u2019s actually true The problem, which I can\\u2019t quite explain to him, is that you can\\u2019t tell from the image itself which kind it is. So far, though, none of these distinctions seem to get quite what might be bothering my son. But wait. We use images and stories to prepare them for reality, and that preparation influences how they confront it. It\\u2019s a lesson we relearn every day, startling ourselves with our own gullibility, and living with the consequences. Raising questions about the very idea of what\\u2019s real has led to some of the most important, classic work in philosophy \\u2013 from Parmenides to Aristotle to Avicenna to Aquinas to Immanuel Kant. Its appearance, we might say, is the way it manifests itself. The distinction is at least as old as philosophy, and often we say that\\u2019s about when it started \\u2013 proto-philosophers and proto-scientists of the 6th and 5th century BCE such as Thales, Anaxagoras, Empedocles and Leucippus making assertions about the fundamental reality underlying natural phenomena: the basic elements, atoms, or even numbers, if we can trust what we\\u2019ve heard about Pythagoras. How to explain the difference? That\\u2019s one reason for thinking that these questions have good credentials. The question comes right back again. It\\u2019s a distinction that seems too obvious to be worth noticing for an adult \\u2013 of course, a bed isn\\u2019t a boat, no matter how many pieces of string or scarves you drape around it. One of the most familiar contrasts we draw is between reality and appearance. I have a professional interest in this query. Done. But when, if ever, does reality itself become an object of curiosity, or puzzlement, or wonder \\u2013 and why? This is different again from the kind of illusion of motion we get from certain patterns: here there\\u2019s no change in the object at all, but still an appearance of motion. My son is only four, and by the time he\\u2019s able to explain what he means by Why?, he\\u2019ll have forgotten what puzzled him \\u2013 if he hasn\\u2019t already. I could say: \\u2018You have a body, but Elsa doesn\\u2019t.\\u2019 (I suspect that, for a lot of grownups, this is the obvious answer.) Elsa wears dresses, though, and you need a body for that, so I can\\u2019t say her body isn\\u2019t real without begging the question. Yes, we\\u2019re real \\u2013 but Elsa and Anna, two characters from Frozen, are not. Just as there are multiple ways of asking or answering the question Why?, there are surprisingly many ways of distinguishing what\\u2019s real from what isn\\u2019t. So there are at least three types of things that might be contrasted as appearance rather than reality: manifestations, mere appearances, and illusions. You\\u2019re cranky because you haven\\u2019t eaten; we\\u2019re driving because we need to get food; this food is healthy because it has the nutrients you need. Unless he\\u2019s prepared in the right way, a child won\\u2019t even recognise why something is good But it\\u2019s important to see why Plato thinks we need these early stories that are \\u2018false on the whole, but contain some truth\\u2019. Did I even address my son\\u2019s actual question, or was I responding to a projected image of my own? For a four-year-old, real is usually contrasted, not with what\\u2019s derivative, or with illusion, or non-existence, but with pretend or make-believe. We need them to learn our way around the world when we\\u2019re completely helpless in it, well before we have any idea what we\\u2019re learning, or why it\\u2019s important. I suppose the right answer has something do with the fact that trustworthy images are causally connected to their subjects in the right ways, and carry information about them because of these causal connections, but I don\\u2019t think we\\u2019re ready for that. Like little Aristotles with their legs dangling from their car seats, their Whys are \\u2018said in many different ways\\u2019. After all, children learn a lot by pretending, and they use make-believe to get a grip on what they experience. A well-crafted story can affect us whether or not we think it\\u2019s actually true, since by default \\u2013 in fact, by training \\u2013 we trust them without thinking that they must meet ordinary standards of literal truth. And how does one sort of making result in something that\\u2019s real, while another sort results in something that isn\\u2019t? For Plato, though, the crucial part is that the relation between these stories and artworks has a special role that plays on their two aspects: as images, they characterise our early ignorance, but in early childhood they are also one of the only ways to reach us. I settle for something a bit simpler: he can do whatever he decides to do, but Elsa can do only what happens in the story. I could talk about how animation is made, as opposed to photographs, but I doubt he\\u2019d understand it from a description. The easy question came first, a few months after my son turned four: \\u2018Are we real?\\u2019 It was abrupt, but not quite out of nowhere, and I was able to answer quickly. But when the question is \\u2018Why am I real?\\u2019, what other thing is there to fill in the blank after \\u2018because\\u2019? He\\u2019s learning about the world, and learning how to ask questions about it at the same time, so there are at least two moving targets. Some images tell us about what\\u2019s real, and some are just pictures. (The connection itself, as he notes, has been made before, going back at least to the Austrian-born historian E H Gombrich.) A huge amount of what children come to experience or notice in their first few years are things we introduce to them through pictures and stories \\u2013 from objects and animals to things such as work, conflict, daydreaming, fear, safety and more. We need to trust them \\u2013 and we must suspect them. Still, what on Earth is there for a four-year-old to be puzzled about? His solution \\u2013 censorship \\u2013 is notorious, and can sound radical, but in some degree or other almost everyone accepts his statement of the problem, and some version of his solution. No wonder we trust them, and no wonder they\\u2019re an especially soft target for exploitation.
