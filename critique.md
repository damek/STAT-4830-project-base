# Self-Critique Document

This self-critique follows the OODA (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) process to guide improvements for the next draft of the project report.

---

## OBSERVE

- **Critical Review:**  
  I re-read the report with fresh eyes and ran the code again to verify the results. The problem statement and technical approach are clearly laid out, though some sections (especially the mathematical formulation and initial results) appear less rigorous than desired.

- **Initial Reactions:**  
  While the overall structure is logical, the explanation of constraints and hyperparameter tuning lacks sufficient detail, and the performance metrics need deeper analysis.

## ORIENT

### Strengths
- **Clear Problem Statement:**  
  The report effectively outlines a concrete problem with significant real-world impact in protein synthesis and drug development.
- **Solid Technical Foundation:**  
  The choice of transformer architecture, masked language modeling strategy, and PyTorch implementation strategy are well-justified and align with state-of-the-art approaches.
- **Comprehensive Planning:**  
  Detailed steps for data preparation, model architecture, training, and validation methods are provided, offering a clear roadmap for implementation.

### Areas for Improvement
- **Mathematical Rigor:**  
  The mathematical formulation of the objective function and constraints is informal. It needs a more precise and rigorous presentation.
- **Performance Analysis:**  
  The initial results section should include more detailed performance metrics and error analysis to better understand model behavior.
- **Experimental Strategy:**  
  A structured plan for hyperparameter tuning and deeper analysis of architecture choices is needed, rather than relying on iterative guesswork.

### Critical Risks/Assumptions
- The report assumes that public genomic datasets are sufficiently representative and that scaling the dataset or tuning hyperparameters will naturally improve accuracy.  
- It also assumes that a transformer model will capture the necessary biological complexity, potentially overlooking challenges inherent in protein folding predictions.

## DECIDE

### Concrete Next Actions
- **Refine Mathematical Formulation:**  
  Clearly define all variables, constraints, and assumptions in the objective function using formal notation and examples.
- **Enhance Performance Reporting:**  
  Expand the initial results section with detailed metrics, error cases, and visualizations to illustrate model learning trends and shortcomings.
- **Develop Tuning Protocol:**  
  Outline a systematic strategy for hyperparameter tuning (e.g., grid search, learning rate schedules) and document experimental results to guide further model refinements.

## ACT

### Resource Needs
- **Computational Resources:**  
  Additional GPU/TPU time will be necessary for extended experiments and hyperparameter tuning, especially as the dataset scales up.
- **Technical Guidance:**  
  I plan to review advanced PyTorch tutorials and consult relevant literature on transformer optimization and protein sequence modeling. Collaborating with a bioinformatics expert would also help ensure that the model's outputs meet biological plausibility criteria.
- **Documentation Tools:**  
  Utilizing tools like TensorBoard or Weights & Biases for detailed experiment tracking and visualization will be crucial in implementing the enhanced evaluation strategy.
